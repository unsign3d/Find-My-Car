Find My Car
==============

Overview
--------

Remember when you used to walk around the city to find your car
because you, just like me, don't have the short-time memory?
This is the solution of this problem.

Android version
----------------
This project requires minumum the sdk 9, probably it goes
on the sdk 8 changing the values but I didn't check out...

Requires the Google Play Services SDK

Make it work
-------------
Due to make it work the whole thing you need to get an API key
from Google

https://code.google.com/apis/console

to sign your application just put the api key in the manifest,

Known Bugs
----------
* No support for more than one car (asap)
* No check if gps is turned on (if is off the position is
  inaccurate sometimes)
